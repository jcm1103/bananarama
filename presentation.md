# Gen711 Final Project
## Background
We chose to examine the population structure of 195 Praries Warblers at 10 different sites. This project was of interest, as two members of the group- Alexa Aubrey and Brighid Lamprey- work as Undergraduate researchers in Adriaan Kovach's lab, examining Prarie Warbler populations. In this abbreviated study, the sites we chose to examine were six local New Hampshire sites (Bow Bog, Destiny Way Gravelpit, Old Mill Lee Power Line, Peter's Gravelpit, Severino, and Woodhill), and one site from Maine (Bills Lane/Perry Oliver), Massachusetts, New York, and Arkansas. The sites were selectively chosen as they represent the location of Prarie Warbler populations within our home states, with Arkansas as an outlier to examine if there was increased genetic diversity based on geographical distance. The samples used were collected from collaborators and from Kovach's lab where they underwent DNA extraction and PCR amplification with 11 different microsatellites. From the data collected, a Discrimination Analysis of Principle Components (DAPC) and an Isolation By Distance with Mantel test was run. The DAPC was performed to explore the structure of Prarie Warbler populations without making assumptions of Panmixia (random mating).



  -looking into prarie warbler pop structure
  -Arkansas, Mass, New York, Maine, Bills Lane/Perry Oliver New Hampshire (Bow Bog, Destiny Way gravel Pit, Old Mill Lee/Power Line, Peters Pit, Severino, Woodhill)
  -looking at the genetic diversity
  -samples collected from collaboraters and Adriaan Kovach Lab
  -we were interested
  -local NH sites
  -outlier from arkansas
  -mass and ny because that is where peeople are from
 -DAPC- discriminate analysis of principle components--- way to explore structure of populations without making assumptions of Panmixia
 -isolation by distance with mentel test- statisticial test of correlation between two matrices (genetic and geopraphical distance) geographic distance versus genetic distance -- determine correlation based on slope value
